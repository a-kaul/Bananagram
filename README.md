## ✨ Features

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses Google Gemini to understand your photos and suggest perfect transformations
- **Personalized Magic Filters**: Get 5 custom transformation suggestions for every photo
- **Image & Video Creation**: Transform still images into dynamic videos or enhanced photos
- **Instagram-like UI**: Familiar, intuitive interface with smooth animations
- **Secure API Management**: Safe, open-source-ready API key handling

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Xcode 15.0 or later
- iOS 17.0 or later
- Swift 5.9 or later

### API Keys Required

You'll need API keys from:
1. **Google Gemini API** - For AI analysis and suggestions
   - Get your key at: https://ai.google.dev/
2. **fal.ai Key Pair** - For image/video transformations using the official fal-swift package
   - Get your key pair at: https://fal.ai/dashboard
   - Format: `FAL_KEY_ID:FAL_KEY_SECRET`

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/bannanagram.git
   cd bannanagram
   ```

2. **Set up API configuration**
   ```bash
   # Copy the configuration template
   cp Config/Development.xcconfig.template Config/Development.xcconfig
   ```
   
   Edit `Config/Development.xcconfig` with your API keys:
   ```
   FAL_AI_API_KEY = your_fal_ai_api_key_here
   GEMINI_API_KEY = your_gemini_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Configure Xcode Project**
   - Open `Bannanagram.xcodeproj` in Xcode
   - Select the project in the navigator
   - Under "Project > Bannanagram > Info"  
   - Set "Configurations" to use `Config/Development.xcconfig` for Debug

4. **Build and run**
   - Select your target device/simulator
   - Press Cmd+R to build and run

### Key Features Implementation

1. **AI Analysis Flow**
   - Photo upload → Gemini API analysis → Structured insights
   - Generates 5 personalized transformation suggestions
   - Fallback to mock suggestions for development

2. **Transformation Pipeline**
   - Suggestion selection → fal.ai API transformation
   - Real-time progress tracking with phases
   - Error handling with retry capabilities

3. **Secure API Management**
   - Environment variable loading
   - Runtime key validation
   - Development-friendly error messages

## 🔒 Security

- API keys are loaded from environment variables
- Never committed to version control (see `.gitignore`)
- Runtime validation ensures keys are present
- Graceful fallback for development without keys

## 🎨 UI/UX Design

- **Instagram-inspired**: Familiar navigation and interactions
- **Magical animations**: Smooth transitions and progress indicators
- **Accessibility**: VoiceOver support and dynamic type
- **Dark mode**: Automatic system appearance adaptation
